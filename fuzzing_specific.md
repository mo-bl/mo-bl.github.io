# Fuzzing Real Firmware
`For master's or bachelor's thesis`  

The idea of this thesis topic is that you try to fuzz actual firmware found in the real world. 
Specifically, we want to look at sufficiently complex systems like, industrial control systems, smart home devices, etc.

As a first step you would get familiar with firmware fuzzing, before selecting a target.  
Either you can use an existing open-source firmware, or more ideally you extract the firmware from an actual device to fuzz it.  
This requires some knowledge of embedded devices or at least the willingness to learn a lot about firmware extraction.

This topic is more suited for a bachelor's thesis but can be extended to a master's thesis if you are interested in that topic.
