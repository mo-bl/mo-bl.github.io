My name is Moritz Bley and since November 2023 I am a PhD student at [CISPA Helmholtz](https://cispa.de/en), working for Prof. Thorsten Holz in the System Security group.  

Before starting at CISPA I studied computer science at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen and IT security at the Ruhr University Bochum. During my bachelor's studies in Erlangen I already started working on security-related topics. For my Bachelors thesis on _Breaking the Trusted Firmware in Huawei Devices_ I was awarded first place in the [CAST award](https://www.cs1.tf.fau.de/2020/11/26/germanys-best-bachelors-thesis-in-it-security-moritz-bley-receives-cast-award-2020/).  

Afterward, I relocated to Bochum and studied IT-Security at the Ruhr University Bochum, which I completed in 2023. During this time I already started working in the System Security group, which - back then - was located at the Ruhr University Bochum, where I mainly did research on firmware security as a research assistant. 

My main research interest is the automated security analysis of firmware through rehosting. This technique utilizes fuzzing to run monolithic firmware on a powerful host using an emulator. Building on previous research I want to improve scalable security analysis in this field to ultimately make firmware more secure.

Beyond that I am also interested in the general field of fuzzing as a tool to detect vulnerabilities

If you are interested in any of these topics or have other ideas you would like to explore in a bachelor's or master's thesis feel free to contact me!

# Open thesis topics
I am mainly interested in large scale security analysis (of firmware) through fuzzing (Fuzzing is a technique where a target is repeatedly executed with semi-random inputs and its behavior is observed for crashing or erroneous behavior).  
If you are interested in program analysis, firmware or fuzzing in general and want to write a thesis feel free to contact me.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
