My name is Moritz Bley and since November 2023 I am a PhD student at [CISPA Helmholtz](https://cispa.de/en), working for Prof. Thorsten Holz in the System Security group.  

Before starting at CISPA I studied in computer science at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen and IT security at the Ruhr University Bochum. During my bachelor's studies in Erlangen I already started working on security-related topics. For my Bachelors thesis on _Breaking the Trusted Firmware in Huawei Devices_ I was awarded first place in the [CAST award](https://www.cs1.tf.fau.de/2020/11/26/germanys-best-bachelors-thesis-in-it-security-moritz-bley-receives-cast-award-2020/).  

Afterward, I relocated to Bochum and studied IT-Security at the Ruhr University Bochum, which I completed in 2023. During this time I already started working in the System Security group, which - back then - was located at the Ruhr University Bochum, where I mainly did research on firmware security as a research assistant. 

My main research interest is the automated security analysis of firmware through rehosting. This technique utilizes fuzzing to run monolithic firmware on a powerful host using an emulator. Building on previous research I want to improve scalable security analysis in this field to ultimately make firmware more secure.

Beyond that I am also interested in the general field of fuzzing as a tool to detect vulnerabilities


This page is designed to list any publications as well as any open research topics for theses.  

If you are interested in any of these topics or have other ideas you would like to explore in a bachelor's or master's thesis feel free to contact me!

# Open thesis topics
I am mainly interested in large scale security analysis (of firmware) through fuzzing (Fuzzing is a technique where a target is repeatedly executed with semi-random inputs and its behavior is observed for crashing or erroneous behavior).  
If you are interested in program analysis, firmware or fuzzing in general and want to write a thesis feel free to contact me. These are topics I would like to explore, but I am open for other ideas as well!

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
